				<p>Sometimes we believe things because they feel best. Deep down, we know they&rsquo;re dubious. But they&rsquo;re convenient, whether it&rsquo;s psychologically or emotionally.</p>
<p>Why do we do this?</p>
<p>According to dissonance theory, it may be because we prefer our beliefs and attitudes to be as consistent as possible. In fact, we&rsquo;re so averse to inconsistencies that we often create or reject new beliefs based more on their consistency than truth. This can lead us to make some questionable decisions, like staying with that terrible boyfriend or smoking before a gym class.</p>
<p>What follows are the three essential ideas that constitute the theory of cognitive dissonance.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="1-inconsistency-is-discomforting">1. Inconsistency is discomforting<a href="#1-inconsistency-is-discomforting" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>We humans have a thing for uniformity. We like scales and rhythm in our music. We like traditions, dress codes, and recipes. We even find symmetrical faces more attractive. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Conversely, we often find inconsistency discomforting. Be it clashing colors, hypocrites, or the best team losing: inconsistency makes us by-and-large uncomfortable.</p>
<p>According to dissonance theory, this discomfort with inconsistency holds true for knowledge, opinions and beliefs. Namely, it proposes that we experience inconsistent or contradicting sets of knowledge, opinions and beliefs as discomforting. If they don&rsquo;t fit well together, we find it distressing to entertain them.</p>
<p>Smokers are often wheeled-out as the first example. Typically, smokers know that their habit is damaging their health. And yet, they also know that they smoke. The inconsistency between them wanting to be healthy and simultaneously damaging their own health causes some kind of discomfort, be it experienced as stress, guilt etc.</p>
<p>Just as this discomfort can vary in form, it can also vary in magnitude. A small disjuncture between beliefs can cause minimal discomfort and be largely ignored. A big inconsistency, however, can be experienced as a jarring psychological pain. Our discomfort is relative to the magnitude of inconsistency between the conflicting knowledge, opinions and beliefs.</p>
<h2 id="2-inconsistency-is-ubiquitous">2. Inconsistency is ubiquitous<a href="#2-inconsistency-is-ubiquitous" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>While we typically maintain consistency between the beliefs and knowledge we carry around in our heads, it takes effort.</p>
<p>First and foremost, reality is coming at us thick and fast. The world is changing, constantly proving us slightly wrong. We calibrate, updating beliefs on the fly to align them with what we perceive to be new, true beliefs. This is the prized fuel of intelligence. But it&rsquo;s also a steady state of psychological inconsistency we&rsquo;re forced to live with.</p>
<p>Expectations are among the beliefs that we constantly square-off against facts.</p>
<p>I can expect my manager to give me a promotion right up to the moment (or even after if I&rsquo;m dogged) her telling me I won&rsquo;t be getting one. In this moment I&rsquo;m momentarily maintaining two opposing beliefs (&ldquo;I will get a promotion&rdquo; and &ldquo;I will not get a promotion&rdquo;). This is discomforting professionally, but also psychologically.</p>
<p>Beyond expectations, reality also forces us to make choices, many of which necessarily involve actively rejecting things that we desire or actively accepting things we dislike. In these circumstances we&rsquo;re left holding two or more contradictory beliefs, like &ldquo;I like that” and “I rejected that”.</p>
<p>Restaurant menus offer quaint case studies of this dilemma. For example, Alice might struggle deciding between Pizza and Risotto. She likes both dishes and knows that either would be enjoyable. When she eventually chooses Pizza, Alice is forced to maintain the belief that she desires Risotto and simultaneously rejects it.</p>
<p>The point here is not that Alice should feel a discomforting regret or loss as she awaits her Neapolitan. Rather, it&rsquo;s that an inconsistency in her beliefs, albeit a small one in this case, was forced upon her. With choice comes active rejection.</p>
<p>For these reasons and more, inconsistencies in our knowledge, opinions and beliefs are ubiquitous and unavoidable.</p>
<h2 id="3-we-minimize-inconsistencies-to-minimize-discomfort">3. We minimize inconsistencies to minimize discomfort<a href="#3-we-minimize-inconsistencies-to-minimize-discomfort" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>We now come to the fascinating mechanism at the heart of dissonance theory used to predict behavior: distress drives us to reduce inconsistencies among knowledge, opinions and beliefs.</p>
<p>Leon Festinger, a pioneer of the theory, suggests that this drive be thought of as analogous to how hunger drives our eating behavior.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A primitive psychological force propelling decision-making that can explain and predict individual behavior.</p>
<p>Just as we choose certain behavior to avoid the distress of hunger, dissonance theory suggests that we choose certain knowledge, opinions and beliefs to avoid the distress of inconsistencies (cognitive dissonance). It&rsquo;s this choosing that may explain some quirky decisions, like staying with that terrible boyfriend and smoking before a gym class.</p>
<p>There are <strong>three ways we reduce these inconsistencies</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="firstly-we-reject-knowledge-opinions-and-beliefs-that-are-inconsistent-with-those-we-have">Firstly, we reject knowledge, opinions and beliefs that are inconsistent with those we have.<a href="#firstly-we-reject-knowledge-opinions-and-beliefs-that-are-inconsistent-with-those-we-have" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>
<p>This is perhaps the most intuitive approach to protecting a precious flock: building a fence. Here, stereotypes and assumptions prevent us from perceiving nuance. Confirmation bias leads us to favor information that confirms our prior beliefs. We reject evidence without even evaluating it. You get the idea.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t just the stuff of outright dogmatism. It&rsquo;s also an important means of maintaining a positive outlook. For example, to maintain the belief that we will win a game, we actively choose not to believe our competitors are capable of winning. We move beyond logic to reject possibilities in order to strengthen existing beliefs and desires. This can be for better and worse. The premise of dissonance theory is solely that it&rsquo;s in part driven by a discomfort with inconsistency.</p>
<h4 id="secondly-we-change-existing-knowledge-opinions-or-beliefs-to-decrease-their-inconsistency">Secondly, we change existing knowledge, opinions or beliefs to decrease their inconsistency.<a href="#secondly-we-change-existing-knowledge-opinions-or-beliefs-to-decrease-their-inconsistency" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>
<p>By stopping smoking, our smoker&rsquo;s belief that it&rsquo;s unhealthy becomes more consistent with their wish (to be healthy) and behavior (to not smoke). By snuffing out our expectation of a promotion, we end its conflict with the knowledge we wont be getting one.</p>
<p>This method of reducing dissonance may seem eminently more deductive and scientific. However, it does not necessarily involve an existing belief changing to better match reality. Instead, we might also choose to replace a true belief with a false one in order to complement other beliefs or knowledge we maintain.</p>
<p>For example, a child might believe that reindeer don&rsquo;t fly until a number of trusted people provide contrary testimony the week before Christmas. Despite never seeing a flying reindeer, the child may start believing that they exist to reduce the inconsistency with his prior understanding and his beliefs about the honestly of his merry sources of information. Its more convenient to believe in Rudolf as it results in less dissonance than the alternative.</p>
<p>Unlike our beliefs about the physical world, our preferences are much more conducive to arbitrary change and, according to dissonance theory, thereby liable to change to accommodate conflicting new knowledge or belief.</p>
<p>For example, if asked why she rejected Risotto despite desiring it, Alice can easily downplay her love for Risotto after the fact. By diminishing her desire for Risotto, she can reduce the cognitive dissonance caused by rejecting it. This is referred to as choice-induced preference change.</p>
<p>While changing preferences after a decision may seem irrational or dishonest, it&rsquo;s also a vital way we mitigate regret. To bolster the choices we&rsquo;ve made, we stack our preferences in their favor after the fact, regardless of how they appeared when we made the decision.</p>
<h4 id="the-third-method-of-reducing-inconsistencies-between-knowledge-opinions-and-beliefs-is-to-create-new-ones">The third method of reducing inconsistencies between knowledge, opinions and beliefs is to create new ones.<a href="#the-third-method-of-reducing-inconsistencies-between-knowledge-opinions-and-beliefs-is-to-create-new-ones" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>
<p>New beliefs can reinforce existing ones, thereby reducing the magnitude of dissonance caused by a new, conflicting belief.</p>
<p>For example, a smoker may introduce the belief that she will soon quit. While this won&rsquo;t remove all of the dissonance caused by her continued smoking, it will reduce it. To further reduce the inconsistency, she might also entertain the belief that her lack of exercise has greater negative health implications, thereby diminishing the importance of her quitting.</p>
<p>As you too may admit, such rationalization can get creative as we churn-out imaginative new scenarios and narratives to reduce conflicting information and justify bad habits. This is possible because we&rsquo;re not limited by reality. We&rsquo;re free to lean on mere potential facts or unverified beliefs to support those we have that are in a state of conflict.</p>
<p>But we also come up with new beliefs and behavior to support desired goals. This is the mechanism at play in what James Clear calls <a href="https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits">Identity-Based Habits</a> : &lsquo;To change your behavior for good, you need to start believing new things about yourself.&rsquo; In other words, create beliefs that are consistent with your desired behavior. Done correctly, not performing the desired habit will cause more dissonance than doing it.</p>

<p>Yes, distilling the theory into three ideas borders on abstraction. This text, therefore, isn&rsquo;t the simplest introduction to the subject out there. Thankfully, we have Wikipedia for that. However it does provides opportunities to distill and therein recognize central ideas. It also makes it easier to put the theory in wider contexts.
