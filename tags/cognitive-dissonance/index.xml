      <description>Sometimes we believe things because they feel best. Deep down, we know they&amp;rsquo;re dubious. But they&amp;rsquo;re convenient, whether it&amp;rsquo;s psychologically or emotionally.
Why do we do this?
According to dissonance theory, it may be because we prefer our beliefs and attitudes to be as consistent as possible. In fact, we&amp;rsquo;re so averse to inconsistencies that we often create or reject new beliefs based more on their consistency than truth. This can lead us to make some questionable decisions, like staying with that terrible boyfriend or smoking before a gym class.</description>
